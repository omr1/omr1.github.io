	Dr.  Barry Pass received his dental degree at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
	He then attended the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, where he 
	completed a residency in oral and maxillofacial radiology (OMFR) after having already 
	earned a B.Sc. in mathematics (City College of NY), and a M.Sc. and Ph.D. in physics from 
	Rutgers University. 

	For the past several years, Dr. Pass has served as Director of OMFR and as a professor in the 
	Department of Oral Diagnostic Services at Howard University College of Dentistry. Dr. Pass 
	is a Diplomate of the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology and a recognized 
	expert of radiation physics. He is also a member of the American Academy of Oral and 
	Maxillofacial Radiology and the District of Columbia Dental Society. Dr. Pass continues 45 
	years of research in radiation physics and radiation accident dosimetry while adding to his 
	numerous peer-reviewed articles.

			<h3>Qutoes by Dr. Barry Pass, DDS, PhD:</h3>
			<pre>
	“After 15 years of general practice and sort of part time academics side to side, I 
	decided I wanted to do full time academics so I looked for a specialty that I thought 
	was the most cerebral and broad. And decided that was radiology!”
	
	“…all imaging modalities involve a lot of physics, a lot of biology, and an 
	opportunity to use many different forms. And it just seemed like it would be a lot 
	more stimulating.”

	“Mostly, my life is academic, but with all those things that go along with academics: 
	teaching clinic and lecture, research, service which means committees for the school 
	and meeting with the students, and sometimes in the evenings, writing reports.” 
 
	

	“...in the country, there’s only maybe 175 maxillofacial radiologists, as opposed to 
	185,000 dentists in the US so it’s a very small group, and that’s nice because it’s very 
	tight knit.”
 


	“Because of cone beam CT, they (OMFR’s) have become more relevant to the dental 
	profession because more dentists are using it and sometimes they’re not up to 
	interpreting the anatomy. …It’s a strange modality, it has peculiarities in it. It takes 
	a lot, initially to understand what you’re looking at!”
